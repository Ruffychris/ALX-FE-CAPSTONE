MY ALX FRONTEND CAPSTONE PROJECT

I am building a Weather DAshboard.
The Weather Dashboard is a responsive web application built with React that allows users to search for and view real-time weather information for cities around the world. It uses a public weather API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data and presents it in a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.

This project simulates a real-world application workflow, including API integration, responsive design, version control, and deployment.
